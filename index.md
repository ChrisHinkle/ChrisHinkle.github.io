## Welcome to my Github page where I will be uploading some projects that I'm currently working on as well as any new projects that I may start.

## Professional Self-Assessment
My education combined with previous work experience has given me a great foundation of knowledge and skills. I learn new technologies quickly and apply those abilities to improve the work I do. Additionally, I have a resourceful approach to problem-solving, tackling challenges head-on, and consider obstacles learning experiences. During the computer science program, I was able to work on numerous programs across multiple programming languages ranging from Python and C++ to Java and SQL. I work well in a team environment but am also capable of working with little to no supervision. I am a good communicator and possess the technical skills to write or verbally discuss options with stakeholders. I have worked with various data structures and algorithms, reverse engineering, database, and system design, as well as secure coding. The projects contained in this portfolio are to showcase my abilities throughout a wide range of skills within computer science and software engineering. From designing and coding a simple weather station to creating a full-stack development, what started out as something I wanted to have fun with has quickly become my choice of career. With a combination of military and manufacturing experience coupled with a BS in Computer Science, I’m a well-rounded critical thinker with more than enough capabilities to solve complex issues.

 **Some examples of my work!**
## Software design and engineering.

[Software design and engineering example.](https://github.com/ChrisHinkle/Software-Design-and-Engineering)
The project that I chose for this section o was a program written in my CS-350 course and utilized a raspberry pi with the GrovePi HAT which read the temperature and humidity settings every 30 minutes and stored that data into a json file. I selected this artifact because it showcases the ability to work with embedded systems. The program itself is written in Python and ran on Linux to interact with the hardware add on. Not only will it showcase the ability to work with embedded systems but it also shows the Python coding involved in creating the artifact. At this stage of working on the first artifact, everything looks good, everything is well documented through inline comments and is laid out very neatly. I have added a light sensor and a sound sensor as well as an LCD RGB display that will change colors based on temperature and humidity readings. The process of enhancing this artifact is fairly straight forward. The challenges of this artifact are deciding which sensors to incorporate and making sure that there are sufficient ports for the sensors that are added.





## FullStack Development

[Full Stack Development example](https://github.com/ChrisHinkle/FullStack-Development/tree/main/Christopher%20Hinkle%20Milestone%20Four)
This project started as a simple python script to interact with a local MongoDB to show algorithms and data structure as well as database interactions. I chose to take a new route on the final project and turn this project into a full-stack development to show that not only do I have the ability to work with algorithms and data structures but I can also work with databases both locally and remotely. This project contains quite a few components that will showcase my abilities. The database is remotely hosted and the actions performed are done through a front-end app interacting with a back-end and middleware. I have successfully created the logic to handle user files using multer and token authentication using bcrypt with a one-way algorithm and decryption key to hash user passwords and ensured that filenames will not run into overwriting issues by appending the date to image files, I have also required that user accounts be unique as an added protection. I feel that I’ve met the course objectives that I had planned to meet and well beyond my original plans to create a fully functional full-stack development.
The process of working on this artifact has opened a whole new avenue for me in development because throughout my work on this project I’ve learned how to handle user files correctly and also learned how to work with authorization tokens. I faced quite a few challenges during this project because initially, I had minimal knowledge of authorization tokens and how they were implemented and after working with them in person I feel that I’ve gained another skill that I can carry with me. Since these were fairly new to me I had to do some research into exactly how multer and bcrypt function and will include the links below.
